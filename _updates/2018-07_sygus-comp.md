For the second time, our loop invariant inference tool [_LoopInvGen_{:.small-caps}][LoopInvGen]
(based on [PIE]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/pldi2016_pie)) won the _Inv_{:.small-caps} track of [SyGuS-Comp 2018].
We received a [FLoC Olympic Games] medal, which is awarded every 4 years.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We solved $91\%$ of the benchmarks ---
was the fastest solver for $89\%$ of them,
and produced the shortest invariants for $74\%$ of them.
