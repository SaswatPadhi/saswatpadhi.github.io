My first patent application with Google ---
which also happens to be my first one as the first inventor =far^smile^fa= ---
was approved for non-provisional filing by the legal team.
Thanks to Google for the filing bonus, the milestone award puzzle piece,
and to my then-manager (Sunil) for a spot bonus!
