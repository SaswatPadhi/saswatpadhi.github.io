We released the third iteration of the syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) language standard at [SYNT 2021].
The major extensions in the [SyGuS 2.1 Standard]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/sygus2021_standard) include support for oracles (contributed by [Elizabeth Polgreen]), a new `CHC_X` logic (that generalizes the previous `Inv_X` logic, contributed by me), and a new theory of tables (contributed by [Andrew Reynolds] and [Chenglong Wang]).
<br>
The 2021 SyGuS competition was postponed,
but we would be adding corresponding new competition tracks in the 2022 competition.
