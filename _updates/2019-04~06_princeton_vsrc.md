I am visiting the [PL group][PL@Princeton] at [Princeton University] for the spring quarter.
I would be collaborating with [Prof. David Walker][David Walker]'s group and
my advisor [Prof. Todd Millstein][Todd Millstein], who is currently visiting there as well,
on invariant synthesis and related problems.
