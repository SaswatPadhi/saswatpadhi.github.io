I am serving on the artifact evaluation committees of [SAS 2019] and SPLASH-[OOPSLA 2019] conferences.
Artifact evaluation ensures that the results claimed in research papers are easily and accurately reproducible.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unlike OOPSLA, SAS requests authors of all papers (not just accepted papers) to submit their artifacts,
which are due immediately after the paper submission deadline.
The SAS program committee will also have access to the artifact reviews by the artifact evaluation committee.
