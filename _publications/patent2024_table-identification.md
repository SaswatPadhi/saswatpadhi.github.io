###### Abstract

Systems, methods, and computer-readable storage devices are disclosed
for improved table identification in a spreadsheet.
One method including: receiving a spreadsheet including at least one table;
identifying, using machine learning, one or more classes of a plurality of classes
for each cell of the received spreadsheet, wherein the plurality of classes
include corners and not-a-corner;
and inducing at least one table in the received spreadsheet
based on the one or more identified classes for each cell of the received spreadsheet.
